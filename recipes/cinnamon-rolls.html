            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together milk, melted butter, and sugar.  Mixture should be just warm, around 100-110°</li>
                <li>Sprinkle yeast evenly over warm mixture and let set for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add 5 cups of the flour and the salt to the milk mixture and mix with wooden spoon until just combined.</li>
                <li>Cover bowl with towel or plastic wrap and set in warm place to rise for 1 hour. After 1 hour, dough should have nearly doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Remove the towel and add the last ½ cup of flour.  Stir well, then turn out onto a well-floured surface.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough lightly, adding additional flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness and doesn’t stick to the surface.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½ inch thick.  Make sure corners are sharp and even.</li>
                <li>In small bowl, cream butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon together for the filling.  </li>
                <li>Spread filling evenly over the dough.</li>
                <li>Roll up the dough, forming a log, and pinch the seam closed.  Place seam-side down.  Trim off any unevenness on either end.</li>
                <li>Use floss or string to cut log in half, then divide each half into 7 evenly sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Generously rub 2 disposable foil pie pans (or just regular glass pans) with butter.</li>
                <li>Place 7 cinnamon rolls in each pie pan, then cover with plastic wrap and place in warm place to rise for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°</li>
                <li>Remove plastic wrap and bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Frost while still warm.</li>
            </ol>
